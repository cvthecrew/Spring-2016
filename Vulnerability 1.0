Vulnerability Assessment is the process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities. Most companies will test their own systems for vulnerabilities, and some companies are constantly testing there systems for vulnerabilities. All changes are also ran through a vulnerability scan. Which I think is a great idea for a company to do if they have the resources to do so.  

Penetration Testing(p-testing): Penetration testers often use vulnerability assessments in some form or another. They will try to exploit the site to see where the vulnerabilities are, and a p-tester may many different vulnerabilities to gain access to a system. Penetration testers are trained to access systems. They are contracted on an agreed upon time frame, where, and what they can access by the owner. Essentially the p-tester plays the role of a hacker to try to find vulnerabilities in his own system.

As I was watching this video I was thinking to myself a penetration tester is a White hat. That is very relate-able when he started talking about the Black, Grey, and White boxes; Those are very similar to white, grey, and black hat hackers.  It seems like this white, black, and grey is the terms used to categorize the degree of an hacker, or hack. Box testing makes me think what is the benefit of doing all three? I didn't think white box testing is a valuable test in terms of penetration testing. I thought that penetration testing needs to be simulation of a hacker trying to get into the system only. but White box testing gives you a threat assessment from the inside of your network which can be useful to have a complete knowledge of your system. This gives you an scope of where you might find vulnerabilities, and how to defend against someone with access.

when you talk about "professional pen testers who are concerned with the level of pen testing that organizations are getting" are you talking about the quality and/or the frequency of Pentesting? Im thinking you mean both. How often do you recommend that a company perform pentesting? We have a guy on our security team that is really good at pentesting whenever there is a major change. That is so true when management is involved it usually comes down to an money and/or effort when a problem arises. But hey right now we all have good health and high metabolism that we will have forever right?

That is insane, the combination of malware and social attacks can be useful combination. It pays to know how to recognize phishing emails. Here is a cool phishing email quiz you can do to test your abilities to recognizing phishing emails by mcafee. https://phishingquiz.mcafee.com/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. It was kindof fun to do. We learned in our undergrad ethical hacking class physical access is complete access.

Haha i love that analogy, i think rob would be great writer. I agree vulnerability assessment is like planning a heist, and understanding the scope of the vulnerabilities in a system. The actual trying to get into the system is pentesting is like performing the heist.
