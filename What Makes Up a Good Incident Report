What makes up a good incident report?

In our Network Forensics class we learned about OSCAR which is an acronym for Obtain information, strategize, Collect evidence, analyze, and Report. I believe even though this is pertaining to network forensics investigative methodology it is still the best practice to prevent evidence corruption. OSCAR should be used whether you’re law enforcement, internal security staff, or a forensic consultant. OSCAR is similar to the other websites key to essential incident reporting from what we read for this assignment. A good Incident Report requires a Who was involved, How the incident was found, How the incident started, what was the effect, where it happened, the motivation on why, and how to prevent an incident similar happening again? So the who, the what, the why, the where, and the how makes a great incident report. If we follow OSCAR we can be sure that the incident is handled the best way possible.

 

Based on the resources, provide your own essential incident response reporting sections

 

I believe the following actions are needed in an incident response and processes:

Description of what happened (With all the updated information)
Date, Time, and Method of incident discovery.
Root Cause
Persons involved
Systems and Data involved
Actions taken since discovery
Immediate
Short Term
Long Term
Summary of internal discussions
Incident manager’s investigative strategy, and process
Legal issues
Timeline of investigation/recovery/ resolution
Potential Impact
Future goals
Short Term
Long Term
Immediate

The car incident is like what we were talking about last week. David Pollino said communication between white hats are essential in order to protect against further attacks. IE: Target and Home Depot POS card information leak.

I also liked how you compared an incident to a support ticket, in many ways it is like a support ticket. Understanding what a problem is and being able to communicate that problem to higher ups, lawyers, government officials, etc(people who dont fully understand anything technical),..... Is very essential in Incident Reporting. I help with a meeting we call a post mortem where we have to explain a problem to my bosses, why it happened, and listen to my co workers explain how we are going to prevent that incident happening in the future.

I love that question is what did we do well, I feel that is a question that is over looked in resolving and reporting incidences. I think the first time I heard about an incident report was when I was interning with you Mark researching different types of incident response plans.

I totally agree with you Bryce, i think that overall tone helps ease everyones tensions. By witty i dont mean inappropriate quotes, but something that gives hope for improvement and like you said confidence.
